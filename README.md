# QACourseTestProject
This was part of course, to create a simple project and exercise some code review skills (always good to know..). I already done this years, but
deiced that this good to go back to basics and practice!

Assignment was:

a.) create a branch to it
b.) do pull request and code review it
c.) document this in a technical essay

## Simple Go project
I was thinking learning a new programming language on top of my Java skills. 
And I thought going back to Golang (has better job coverage than Rust :( ) would be nice! I compiles fast and it's easy to write

## Branching
Created already a main branch, but I'll add some complexity to project and a new branch

# Code review
On Todo list
